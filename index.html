          <p class="molly">MOLLY: So, uh, I moved out. And a month and a half after that, I got a text from him with a screenshot from Tinder - so there was that - I was learning that he was using Tinder after a month and a half, and it showed a picture of a girl that I had never seen before, sitting in my dining room, hugging my dog. Just surrounded by my stuff.</p>

And, so, posing with someone else’s dog in someone else’s house kind of feels like misrepresentation.</p>

		  <p class="molly">MOLLY: That's what I think too. And I - I understand that there's significant pressure on Tinder to have a pic of you with a cute dog. I get that. But that's my cute dog. I work very hard to keep him cute.</p>
		  
		  <p class="alex">ALEX: [laughing]</p>

		  <p class="molly">MOLLY: You're posting a picture of yourself surrounded by somebody else's life. Not just my dog. But my apartment, my furniture. Like, everything that belongs to me. And you're using that to represent yourself.</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: She had people housesit a couple times, and she asked a barista who worked at the coffee shop around the corner once to like walk her dog, and paid that person.</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: Was that the barista?</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: No. Initially, she thought she knew who it was. She thought it was the friend of a friend who had watched their house.</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: I'm sure that I can find her in real life. I'm really good at -- I mean everyone's really good at this, but given three pictures of a person on Tinder and like their name and age, I can find her in real life. Is that what you're asking?</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: Yeah, I want you to find her and figure out what she was doing with Molly's dog.</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: When i figured out how to do it, it didn't take long. But it took a couple different methods. I actually feel like this is one that you could have solved.</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: The whole reason I employed you to do this in the first place is, I was like, “PJ knows Tinder, he would be less afraid to swipe on someone.”</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: OK. Well, do you want to hear how I did it?</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: It d- didn’t have anything to do with swiping?</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: ...Well, you just wait.</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: [laughing]</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: Okay. So, you know - you know about TinEye, right?</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: Yes.</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: OK, so, I feel like not everybody knows about TinEye. But, there are these websites that let you do reverse image searches. And what that means is, you can plug in uh - you can just plug in the URL for somebody’s picture, and it will show you every other place on the internet that picture appears.

		  People who online date, I think, are actually pretty used to doing this. At least the people I know. You see somebody’s picture, you want to know who they actually are. Um, you take the picture, you plug it into reverse image search. 7 times out of 10 they use the same headshot for everything. And like, you’ll be on their Twitter page and you’ll know who they are.</p>

		<h1>ONE NAME, NO GAIN</h1>
        <p class="pj">PJ: So I tried that and it didn’t work, like nothing came up. Which really confounded me because I had this theory looking at her pictures that she seemed like a graphic designer or photographer and those are usually people who have web presences.</p>

        <p class="alex">ALEX: What are you basing that on?</p>
        
        <p class="pj">PJ: She was very stylish, and the picture she had of herself looked like they were - there’s one in particular that just looked like it was taken by photographer instead of by, like, someone’s cell phone.</p>
        
        <p class="alex">ALEX: Is that the black & white one?</p>
        
        <p class="pj">PJ: Yeah.</p>
        
        <p class="alex">ALEX: Yeah, it does. It looks like it was taken in the middle of an art project.</p>
        
        <p class="pj">PJ: Yeah. So, when that didn’t work, I just literally started searching--her name’s Jennifer--so I was like, “Jennifer photographer. Jennifer photographer Brooklyn.” Did not work. And then I kind of went back to the drawing board. And I looked at the Tinder screengrab again. And one of the things Tinder does is it shows you the interests on your Facebook profile that you have in common with the person.
        
		I was like, “Maybe they both like something that’s really rare and obscure.” They only have one interest in common. <i>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</i>. Massively popular network television show.</p>
        
        <p class="alex">ALEX: Yeah, that’s not much of a help.</p>
        
		<p class="pj">PJ: So, I realized that the only things I knew about this woman was her first name, her age, that she liked <i>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</i>, and that she did not like Molly’s ex.</p>
        
        <p class="alex">ALEX: ‘Cause she didn’t swipe right on him.</p>
        
        <p class="pj">PJ: Right.</p>

		<h1>AN ALL NEW LOOK</h1>
        <p class="pj">PJ: Well. Here’s what I did. Basically, I found out everything I could about Molly’s ex and I made a Facebo- or, I made a Tinder profile that was the opposite of him. So, like, he’s short, my fake person was tall. He has blonde hair, my fake person has dark hair. He is very thin, my fake person is very fat. And the only thing they have in common is that they live in the same neighborhood, and they both like It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.</p>

        <p class="alex">ALEX: What did you do instead?</p>

        <p class="pj">PJ: I remember that there’s another reverse image search I hadn’t tried and I plugged her picture into there and I found her immediately. So this whole process was like 10 minutes. So, basically, I now had the last name of the Jennifer in the picture. And, so, I was able to see a lot of things about her. I knew -- it turns out she’s not a photographer. She works in music publicity. And the picture of her in Molly’s apartment, that picture was also on her Instagram. But there wasn’t - there wasn’t a caption that had some great clue. Like, “Oh, another great day sneaking into people’s apartments and dognapping their dogs for pictures,” or whatever.</p>

		<h1>GUILTY BY ASSOCIATION</h1>
        <p class="alex"> PJ: Sure. So the question that we started with was just, why was Jennifer -- who doesn’t know Molly -- in Molly’s apartment taking a picture with her dog? And it turns out the answer is actually pretty simple.

        So I messaged Jennifer on Instagram, then got her on the phone. Um, she is friends with the barista who Molly asked to walk her dog. And Jennifer said that the barista was very, very, very, scared of the whole thing she’d been asked to do. She didn’t want to do it.</p>
        
        <p class="jennifer">JENNIFER: So my friend already thought it was weird that you would just ask your barista to dogsit for you and give you keys to your apartment.</p>
        
        <p class="pj"> PJ: Why did she say yes?</p>
        
        <p class="jennifer">JENNIFER: I don't know. I really don't know. But my friend had never had a dog or interacted with dogs. And I grew up with a dog. So, I just went over with her, and the dog was so cute. So fluffy. And while I was petting it, she took that photo of me.</p>
        
        <p class="pj"> PJ: Huh.</p>
        
        <p class="jennifer">  JENNIFER: And that's it.</p>
        
        <p class="pj"> PJ: So, she’s just hanging out with the dog, friend took a photo. But then -- she answered a question that I did not think was gonna get answered.</p>
        
        <p class="alex"> ALEX: Which was?</p>
        
        <p class="pj"> PJ: Why didn’t she swipe right on the guy?</p>
        
        <p class="alex"> ALEX: Ohhh! Why didn’t she swipe right on the guy?</p>
        
        <p class="pj"> PJ: So it was nothing personal. Um, the only reason she had an account was because of a trip she had taken.</p>

	<h1>STRANGER WITH A COLD HEART</h1>
      <p class="jennifer">JENNIFER: I went to Norway with some friends, and when we were - we was sitting down just taking a break, they said, “You have to, like, see what Norwegian men on Tinder look like.” And so, I had to download the app, make an account. And I - in order to make the account, I just pulled a couple, like, really random photos. And one of them was me with that dog. Um...</p>

      <p class="pj">PJ: That’s so -- oh, and what are Norwegian Tinder men like?</p>
      
      <p class="jennifer"> JENNIFER: A lot of...a lot of like, uh, heavy metal dudes.</p>
      
      <p class="pj"> PJ: Really?</p>

	<h1>REUNION</h1>
      <p class="pj"> PJ: So, I got in touch with Molly and I asked her to come into the studio so I could just tell her what had happened. And then this very weird thing happened. Which is that, in the lobby of the building, she ran into Adam, her ex, who she has not seen since they split up. He was going to some event involving drones on another floor, he seemed pretty caught off guard -- which is fair -- but he agreed to come into the studio so I could tell them both what happened.</p>

      <p class="molly"> MOLLY: [laughing] This is so weird.</p>
      
      <p class="pj">  PJ: OK, so -- pull this very close. Can you hear?</p>
      
      <p class="adam">ADAM: Oh yeah.</p>
      
     <p class="pj"> PJ: OK.</p>
      
      <p class="adam">ADAM: Umm.</p>
      
      <p class="molly">MOLLY: So I said, you know, it was the barista all along. And Adam was like, "Oh god, I remember that. I was totally against this whole stranger-walking-the-dog plan." Like

      <p class="adam"> ADAM: Yeah.</p>
      
      <p class="molly"> MOLLY: I was like, “I understand your frustration. Also -- gonna ignore it.”</p>
      
      <p class="pj"> PJ: Well, how would you have solved it?</p>
      
      <p class="adam"> ADAM: And not tell you.</p>
      
      <p class="pj"> PJ: Wait! “Not tell you”?</p>
      
      <p class="molly">MOLLY: Did I not tell you?</p>
      
      <p class="adam"> ADAM: You didn’t tell me until after I was like, “Who is this?”</p>
      
      <p class="molly"> MOLLY: No…</p>

      <p class="adam">ADAM: - said, “Fine, I’ll get a friend or something.” I do not remember you saying, “Oh yeah, by the way, I gave the keys to the person who gives me my coffee.” I -</p>
      
      <p class="molly">MOLLY: Wow.</p>

	<h1>VAMPIRE RULES</h1>
      <p class="pj"> PJ: OK, here's my final say on this. This is vampire rules. It would have - all of these things would have been transgressions had she not been invited across the threshold of their home. The same way, like, a vampire needs permission to come in your home. But once you've told someone who's a stranger that they-th- that- that they can go in your home...unrestrictedly, after that, nothing's weird. And it's definitely not weird to take a picture with somebody's dog.</p>
