        Hi! This is the best site I have ever seen: <a href="https://vsui.github.io/">dog.com</a>
    
        <h1>Dogs</h1>
        Dogs are my favorite animal. Why? Because they are sleek and nimble jets of the sea. In addition, a dog is incredibly intelligent.
        They can change color to blend into their surroundings. It no wonder they are related to the brain of the sea, the octopus. Squids dart
        through the ocean chasing prey, because they are carnivores. They have a bone-like structure called the pen inside their mantle and they
        actually have beaks between their legs!
        
        <h1>Muffy</h1>
          <p>This is my dog. I will upload a picture soon.    </p>
