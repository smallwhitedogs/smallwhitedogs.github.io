And a month and a half after that, I got a text from him with a screenshot from Tinder - so there was that - I was learning that he was using Tinder after a month and a half, and it showed a picture of a girl that I had never seen before, sitting in my dining room, hugging my dog. Just surrounded by my stuff.</p>

Um, and that was about all the information that was included there. And - and my ex texted me with the caption, "Do you know who this is? We have no common friends, uh, and I've never seen her before."</p>

		  <h1>THIS IS MY DOG</h1>
		  <p class="alex">ALEX: Um, going back to Jennifer’s picture -- you know, when you’re on a dating site, you are trying to basically summarize your personality in three photographs or whatever. And, so, posing with someone else’s dog in someone else’s house kind of feels like misrepresentation.</p>

		  <p class="molly">MOLLY: That's what I think too. And I - I understand that there's significant pressure on Tinder to have a pic of you with a cute dog. I get that. But that's my cute dog. I work very hard to keep him cute.</p>
		  
		  <p class="alex">ALEX: [laughing]</p>

		  <p class="molly">MOLLY: You're posting a picture of yourself surrounded by somebody else's life. Not just my dog. But my apartment, my furniture. Like, everything that belongs to me. And you're using that to represent yourself.</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: No...</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: But?</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: She had people housesit a couple times, and she asked a barista who worked at the coffee shop around the corner once to like walk her dog, and paid that person.</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: Was that the barista?</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: No. Initially, she thought she knew who it was. She thought it was the friend of a friend who had watched their house.</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: Uh-huh.</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: She went to the friend and was like, "Hey, is this this a picture of your roommate?" and she was like, "No, I have no idea who that person is.”</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: I'm sure that I can find her in real life. I'm really good at -- I mean everyone's really good at this, but given three pictures of a person on Tinder and like their name and age, I can find her in real life. Is that what you're asking?</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: Yeah, I want you to find her and figure out what she was doing with Molly's dog.</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: Yeah. I can do that. I feel very confident that I can find her.</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: Alright, so. How long did it take you to find this person?</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: When i figured out how to do it, it didn't take long. But it took a couple different methods. I actually feel like this is one that you could have solved.</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: The whole reason I employed you to do this in the first place is, I was like, “PJ knows Tinder, he would be less afraid to swipe on someone.”</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: OK. Well, do you want to hear how I did it?</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: It d- didn’t have anything to do with swiping?</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: ...Well, you just wait.</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: [laughing]</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: Okay. So, you know - you know about TinEye, right?</p>

		  <p class="alex">ALEX: Yes.</p>

		  <p class="pj">PJ: OK, so, I feel like not everybody knows about TinEye. But, there are these websites that let you do reverse image searches. And what that means is, you can plug in uh - you can just plug in the URL for somebody’s picture, and it will show you every other place on the internet that picture appears.

		  People who online date, I think, are actually pretty used to doing this. At least the people I know. You see somebody’s picture, you want to know who they actually are. Um, you take the picture, you plug it into reverse image search. 7 times out of 10 they use the same headshot for everything. And like, you’ll be on their Twitter page and you’ll know who they are.</p>
